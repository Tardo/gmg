  add new sites can be done editing this file)
- Test the analyzer
- spaCy implementation (remove current method)
- Network map of users interactions

  - The thread with the most interactions
  - Most mentioned user (with a random comment (or most voted))
  - A random rude comment (or most voted) from the most rude user [Do this with
    all analysis sections]

- Improve 'Multimedia' page
